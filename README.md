## Project Description

On visiting our page the user will be given a suggestion for a cocktail and a recipe. This recommendation will be based off the weather of the current users location. Looking at various weather statistics such as temperature, rain, snow or sunshine we will attempt to match a drink with ingredients that reflect those conditions.
